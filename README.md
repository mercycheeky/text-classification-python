Text Classification(TC) is the process of assigning tags or categories to text according to its content. It is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Text classifiers can be used to organize, structure, and categorize pretty much anything.

Sentiment analysis the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer’s attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.

In simpler words let’s say that it is when you have a text of review as input and as the output you have to predict the class of sentiment either positive? or negative?
Well, I’m using the movie_reviews corpus in the nltk library for this process. 

naive Bayes classifier is the text classification algorithm.
